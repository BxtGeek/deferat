Hello. I'm James. 

I had no idea how to start a blog, but it's something I've wanted to do for a long time. Enough. Now is the time. You're never going to have a blog until you've written one. And a journey starts with a single step... 

What does any sane person who wants to start a blog do? 

Procrastinate.

Yep, I've always been good at that. Seems like a good place to start. 

Instead of writing some _actual blog posts_, start writing a blog engine instead. That's way more fun. Fiddle around with the styling. Add pretty pictures. Set up a Continuous Integration pipeline. Make it render emojis perfectly! üòÅ 

So I made a blog engine. Then I _started_ writing a few posts about how I made it. Then I tinkered with it some more. Always I knew I'd eventually have to actually put something live - so here we go. Minimum Viable Product. An introduction.

## About me

I live in the weird and wonderful town of Milton Keynes, UK with my wife and two young daughters. I've been working as a .NET developer in a wide variety of industries for over 14 years. In that time I've started countless projects; and even finished some of them. 

I like to tinker with new technology and build things. I love coding and solving problems. 

But I always need to look things up. So partly to give back, and partly so that I remember myself, I've started this blog to store my thoughts and the useful info I don't want to forget.

I'm also a terrible writer. This is bad news for you, mythical reader. But this is an effort to improve.

## About this blog

So what should you expect to read here?

I've got a huge list of things I'd like to write about - weird configurations, arcane incantations and other oddities I've encountered in my time solving problems. 

Mostly I will be writing about things I'm interested in. Probably in C#, possibly in other languages. 

I'm currently interested in 
- [Raspberry Pi](../Posts/Tag/raspberry%20pi/Page/1)
- [Cryptography](../Posts/Tag/cryptography/Page/1)
- [Linux](../Posts/Tag/linux/Page/1)
- [Continuous Integration](../Posts/Tag/devops/Page/1)

Hopefully these categories will soon be full to the brim with useful and interesting posts! But until then, watch this space.

Also, I will be adding new features to the site as I go (that's way more fun than _writing_!). Once everything is cleaned up I'll be putting it on [my Github](https://github.com/euronay/) so you too can have a beautiful blog.

Cheers! üç∏
